### Libraries used <a name="libs"></a>


### Project Motivation <a name="motiation"></a>
As a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program and to enhance my knowledge of cloud computing I chose the Sparkify
Capstone project. For this I tried to answer the following questions:

1. Is an offensive way of playing more advantageous than a defensive one?
2. How important is the usage of what items?
3. Is camping more advantageous than a more agile (moving around) game play?

### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>


### Results <a name="results"></a>

### Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
For this I have to give credit to aws???
