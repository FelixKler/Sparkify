### Libraries used <a name="libs"></a>
To run the code the following libraries should be installed: pyspark, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

### Project Motivation <a name="motiation"></a>
As a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program this project uses the spark technology and machine learning to 
predict churn of a fictional digital music service. I used the following methodology:
 + Data loading
 + Defining churn
 + Explorative data analysis
 + Modeling (applying 3 different machine learning classification models)
 + Evaluation

### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The project is implemented in a jupyter notebook and uses a small subset of data provided by Udacity.

### Results <a name="results"></a>
The results are provided in the jupyter notebook and as a post [here](https://medium.com/@felix.kler/how-to-predict-churn-5d3304bf18).

### Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
For this I have to give credit to Udacity to provide me the necessary data.
